# PLS-Analysis-Software
This repo provides the software and source code for training and testing partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis in C++ programming. 

# Description
- PLS-Analysis-Software provides functionalities for for training and testing partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis   
- It was developed in C++ Programming language.    
- The graphical user interface (GUI) of PLS-Analysis-Software was designed using Qt designer.       
- The C++ tools and libraries used for developing the software include; Standard Template C++ Library, Armadillo C++ Linear Algebra Library, MLPACK C++ Machine learning Library, Boost C++ libraries.    
- Vcpkg package manager from Microsoft was used to install the C++ libraries.    
- The software is fully functional and mainly consists of two main tasks; partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) or classification and partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis tasks.
